# Movie-Recommendation-System
A project made as machine learning assignment in 6th sem of college.

Movie Recommendation System
This repository contains the source code and resources for a movie recommendation system built using Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit.

Overview
The movie recommendation system uses collaborative filtering techniques to suggest movies to users based on their similarity to other movies. It leverages cosine similarity to compute the similarity between movies using their feature vectors.

The system provides a simple web interface built with Streamlit, allowing users to input a movie title and receive a list of recommended movies based on similarity.

Features
Movie Recommendation: Users can input a movie title and receive a list of recommended movies based on similarity.
Interactive Web Interface: The system provides an easy-to-use web interface built with Streamlit for seamless interaction.
Customizable Recommendations: Users can customize the recommendation system by adding their own dataset or adjusting parameters.

Project Structure
app.py: Main Python script containing the Streamlit web application code.
artifacts/: Directory containing serialized data files (e.g., pickled DataFrames, similarity matrices).
data/: Directory for storing movie dataset files.
README.md: Project overview and instructions for setup and usage.

Installation and Setup
To run the movie recommendation system locally, follow these steps:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the Streamlit app using streamlit run app.py.
Access the application through your web browser at http://localhost:8501.
Usage
Enter the title of a movie in the input field.
Click the "Recommend" button to view a list of recommended movies.
Explore the recommended movies and discover new favorites!
Future Improvements
User Authentication: Implement user authentication to provide personalized recommendations.
Enhanced Interface: Add features such as movie ratings, genre filters, and advanced search options.
Deployment: Deploy the application to a cloud platform for wider accessibility.
